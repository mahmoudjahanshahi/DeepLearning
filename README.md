# Deep Learning

This is my personal repository to practice Deep Learning. Inspired by [Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) (offered by deeplearning.ai)

All used datasets are publicly available and their sources have been mentioned in respective directory README files.

Any suggestions or corrections to my codes are absolutely appreciated.
